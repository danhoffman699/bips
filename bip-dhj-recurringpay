==Abstract==

Recurring payments and billing have existed in traditional financial systems for donation and payment for services. This document aims to establish a protocol for requesting routine transactions on some fixed interval, automated requesting of up-to-date Bitcoin outputs, and optionally allow for a second, less intrusive, layer of verification for transaction sending (push notification, TODO: look more into how BIPs properly deal with user verification, I don't know if this should be in the BIP).

==Copyright==
Proposal is licensed under BSD-2-Clause

==Specification==
Just add some variables to payment requests and specify a URL to request new versions from

TODO: more detail

==Motivation==
There are two primary motivations for writing this standard
1. When donating to individuals or organizations, having semi-automated payments voluntarily increases the transaction volume over time
2. A more steady stream of smaller transactions to an address enables receivers to perform statistics on their income and establish a more steady baseline income over time

==Rationale==
Need to properly write the specification, but these are things to keep in mind
1. Replaying the PaymentRequest is needed to generate useful outputs, since Bitcoin is pretty volatile still
2. Push notifications or other end user verification is already required in BIP-0070, but I need to very some of that
